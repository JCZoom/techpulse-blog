                <h3>Plain English Summary</h3>
                <p><strong>TechPulse curates tech and AI news for your convenience.</strong> Use it freely, respect others, and understand we're sharing links—not guaranteeing perfection. If something breaks or bothers you, let us know. We'll be reasonable if you are.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to TechPulse. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website. By accessing or using TechPulse, you agree to these Terms. If you disagree with any part, please don't use the site.</p>
            
            <p>We've written these Terms to be fair and reasonable. We're not trying to trap you in legalese—we just want to be clear about how TechPulse works and what we expect from each other.</p>

            <h2>What TechPulse Is</h2>
            <p>TechPulse is a <strong>curated news aggregation and discovery service</strong> focused on artificial intelligence and technology topics. We:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collect articles from various public RSS feeds and sources</li>
                <li>Score and rank them using AI algorithms based on relevance and quality</li>
                <li>Present them in an easy-to-read format with summaries and links</li>
                <li>Provide tools to help you discover content that matches your interests</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What TechPulse Is Not</h2>
            <p>To be clear:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>We're not a publisher.</strong> We don't write the articles; we link to them</li>
                <li><strong>We're not liable for content.</strong> External articles are the responsibility of their publishers</li>
                <li><strong>We're not comprehensive.</strong> We don't capture every AI/tech story</li>
                <li><strong>We're not perfect.</strong> Our AI curation is smart but not infallible</li>
                <li><strong>We're not a news service.</strong> We're a discovery tool, not a breaking news source</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Rights to Use TechPulse</h2>

            <h3>Free Access</h3>
            <p>TechPulse is free to use. We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:</p>

                <li>Use rating features to personalize your experience</li>
                <li>Export your own ratings data</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>No Account Required</h3>
            <p>You don't need to create an account, which means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can use TechPulse anonymously</li>
                <li>Your personalization (ratings) stays on your device</li>
                <li>You're responsible for backing up any data you want to keep</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>

            <h3>Acceptable Use</h3>
            <p>When using TechPulse, you agree to:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Be honest:</strong> Don't use bots to manipulate ratings or fake engagement</li>
                <li><strong>Don't harm others:</strong> No harassment, hate speech, or illegal content (if we had user-generated content, which we don't)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
            <p>You may not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scrape or download large amounts of content via automated means without permission</li>
                <li>Reverse engineer our ranking algorithms</li>
                <li>Use TechPulse to spread malware or phishing links</li>
                <li>Impersonate TechPulse or claim affiliation without permission</li>
                <li>Copy our design, code, or branding for your own site (but feel free to be inspired!)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Content and Copyright</h2>

            <h3>External Articles</h3>
            <p>The articles we link to are owned by their respective publishers. Copyright belongs to them, not us. When you click a link and read an article, you're subject to that publisher's terms and copyright.</p>

            <h3>Our Content</h3>
            <p>Content we create (site design, our summaries, our code) is © 2025 TechPulse. You may not copy or redistribute it without permission, except for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal, non-commercial use</li>
                <li>Fair use purposes (commentary, criticism, education)</li>
                <li>Sharing links to TechPulse (encouraged!)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User Ratings</h3>
            <p>Your ratings are yours. By rating articles, you give us permission to use that data to improve TechPulse for you. Since ratings stay on your device, you maintain full control.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Links and Services</h2>

            <h3>External Links</h3>
            <p>TechPulse contains links to external websites. We don't control these sites and aren't responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Their content, accuracy, or availability</li>
                <li>Their privacy practices</li>
                <li>Any harm caused by visiting them</li>
                <li>Changes to their content after we link to it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Clicking an external link is at your own risk.</p>

            <h3>No Endorsement</h3>
            <p>Linking to an article doesn't mean we endorse its views, claims, or the publisher. Our algorithm surfaces content we think is relevant and high-quality, but we don't verify every claim or agree with every opinion.</p>

            <h2>Disclaimers and Limitations</h2>

            <h3>No Warranties</h3>
            <p>TechPulse is provided "as is" and "as available." We don't guarantee:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Article summaries may contain errors; read the full article for complete information</li>
                <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> We may miss important stories</li>
                <li><strong>Availability:</strong> The site may experience downtime</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Load times may vary</li>
                <li><strong>Suitability:</strong> Content may not meet your specific needs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, TechPulse and its operators are not liable for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any damages arising from your use of the site</li>
                <li>Loss of data (though we don't store much anyway)</li>
                <li>Business losses or opportunity costs</li>
                <li>Content from third-party sites</li>
                <li>Decisions made based on articles you read</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Some jurisdictions don't allow liability limitations, so these may not apply to you. You may have other rights that vary by location.</p>

            <h3>Reasonable Use Standard</h3>
            <p>We promise to be reasonable; we ask the same of you. If something goes wrong, we'll work in good faith to fix it. If you have a legitimate complaint, we'll listen and try to address it.</p>

            <h2>AI and Algorithmic Curation</h2>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>TechPulse uses AI algorithms to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Score articles based on relevance, quality, and timeliness</li>
                <li>Match content to inferred interests</li>
                <li>Learn from your ratings (stored locally)</li>
                <li>Filter out low-quality or duplicate content</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>No Guarantees</h3>
            <p>While we strive for quality, AI isn't perfect. Sometimes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Great articles are ranked low</li>
                <li>Mediocre articles sneak through</li>
                <li>The algorithm misunderstands your preferences</li>
                <li>Breaking news is missed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We're constantly improving, but TechPulse is a tool—not a replacement for critical thinking.</p>

            <h3>Transparency</h3>
            <p>We believe in algorithmic transparency. Our ranking considers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Semantic similarity to your preferences (via embeddings)</li>
                <li>Source trustworthiness</li>
                <li>Freshness and relevance</li>
                <li>Content quality signals</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We don't artificially boost certain publishers or accept payment for ranking.</p>

            <h2>Privacy and Data</h2>
            <p>Your use of TechPulse is also governed by our <a href="privacy.html" style="color: var(--color-accent);">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. Please read it—we're proud of our privacy-first approach.</p>

            <h2>Changes to TechPulse</h2>

            <h3>Service Changes</h3>

                <li>The "Last Updated" date will change</li>
                <li>Significant changes will be highlighted on the homepage</li>
                <li>Your continued use means you accept the new Terms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you disagree with changes, please stop using TechPulse.</p>

            <h2>Termination</h2>

            <h3>Your Right to Stop</h3>
            <p>You can stop using TechPulse anytime. Since there's no account, just close the browser tab. Your local ratings will remain until you clear them.</p>

            <h3>Our Right to Restrict</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to restrict or ban access if you:</p>

                <li>Violate these Terms</li>
                <li>Abuse the service (e.g., DDoS attacks)</li>
                <li>Engage in illegal activity</li>
                <li>Harm other users or the site</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We'll be reasonable about this. A mistake won't get you banned; malicious behavior will.</p>

            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

            <h3>Trademarks</h3>
            <p>"TechPulse" and our logo are trademarks. You can't use them to imply endorsement or affiliation without written permission.</p>

            <h3>Respecting Others' IP</h3>

            </ul>
            <p>We'll investigate and respond appropriately.</p>

            <h2>Governing Law and Disputes</h2>

            <h3>Jurisdiction</h3>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of [Your Jurisdiction].</p>

            <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>Before filing a lawsuit, let's talk. We commit to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Responding to complaints within 5 business days</li>
                <li>Engaging in good faith discussions</li>
                <li>Seeking reasonable compromises</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most issues can be resolved through communication.</p>

            <h3>No Class Actions</h3>
            <p>Any disputes must be brought individually, not as part of a class action. However, this doesn't prevent you from participating in regulatory proceedings.</p>

            <h2>General Provisions</h2>

            <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p>These Terms and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and TechPulse.</p>

            <h3>No Waiver</h3>
            <p>Our failure to enforce a right doesn't waive that right.</p>

            <h3>Assignment</h3>
            <p>You can't transfer these Terms to anyone else. We may assign our rights and obligations to a successor.</p>

            <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
