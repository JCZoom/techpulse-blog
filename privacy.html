                <h3>Our Privacy Philosophy</h3>
                <p><strong>TechPulse is built on a simple principle: your data is yours.</strong> We believe privacy is a fundamental right, not a luxury. This policy explains how we honor that commitment.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to TechPulse. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our website. Unlike many sites, we've designed TechPulse to be <strong>privacy-first by architecture</strong>, not just by policy.</p>
            
            <p>We are committed to transparency about our practices. This policy uses plain language because we believe you shouldn't need a law degree to understand what happens to your data.</p>

            <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
            <p>Let's start with what matters most:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No user accounts</strong> - You don't sign up, so we never collect your email, name, or credentials</li>
                <li><strong>No tracking cookies</strong> - We don't use cookies to follow you around the internet</li>
                <li><strong>No analytics platforms</strong> - No Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or similar tracking</li>
                <li><strong>No data sales</strong> - We will never, ever sell your data to third parties</li>
                <li><strong>No advertising networks</strong> - No ad networks tracking your behavior</li>
                <li><strong>No fingerprinting</strong> - We don't try to uniquely identify your device</li>
                <li><strong>No email lists</strong> - We don't collect or send marketing emails</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What We Do Collect</h2>

            <h3>1. Server Logs (Minimal)</h3>
            <p>When you visit TechPulse, our web server automatically records basic technical information necessary to serve the website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your IP address (required to send you the webpage)</li>
                <li>Date and time of your visit</li>
                <li>Pages you requested</li>
                <li>Your browser type and operating system</li>
                <li>The referring page (if you clicked a link to get here)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Retention:</strong> These logs are kept for 7 days for security and debugging purposes, then automatically deleted.</p>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> We only review these logs if there's a technical problem or security concern. We never mine them for marketing or behavioral analysis.</p>

            <h3>2. Article Ratings (Your Device Only)</h3>
            <p>When you rate articles using the thumbs up/down feature:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stored locally:</strong> Your ratings are saved in your browser's localStorage</li>
                <li><strong>Never transmitted:</strong> Ratings never leave your device unless you explicitly export them</li>
                <li><strong>You control the data:</strong> You can clear your ratings anytime by clearing browser data</li>
                <li><strong>No server storage:</strong> We never see or store your ratings on our servers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Article Content (Cached)</h3>
            <p>To improve performance, your browser may cache:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Article listings (latest.json)</li>
                <li>CSS and JavaScript files</li>
                <li>Images from external sources</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are standard browser caching mechanisms that you can clear at any time.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Content</h2>

            <h3>External Links</h3>
            <p>TechPulse curates and links to articles from various publishers. When you click these links, you leave our site and become subject to that publisher's privacy policy. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the privacy practices of external sites.</p>

            <h3>External Images</h3>
            <p>Some article images are loaded from the original publisher's servers. When these images load, the publisher may receive your IP address. This is a standard web practice we cannot control. If this concerns you, consider using a browser extension that blocks external images.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Information</h2>

            <h3>Server Logs</h3>
            <p>We use server logs only to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure the website functions properly</li>
                <li>Diagnose technical problems</li>
                <li>Protect against security threats (e.g., DDoS attacks, hacking attempts)</li>
                <li>Understand very basic usage patterns (e.g., "Are people visiting the site?")</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>No Profiling or Targeting</h3>
            <p>We do not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build user profiles</li>
                <li>Track individual behavior across sessions</li>
                <li>Use algorithms to predict your preferences (beyond what you explicitly tell us via ratings)</li>
                <li>Personalize ads (we don't show ads)</li>
                <li>Create audience segments</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>

            <h3>Your Ratings</h3>
            <p>Since your ratings are stored only on your device, their security depends on your device's security. We recommend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a secure, up-to-date browser</li>
                <li>Enabling device encryption</li>
                <li>Using a password/PIN to lock your device</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Server</h3>
            <p>We implement reasonable security measures including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTTPS encryption for all connections</li>
                <li>Regular security updates</li>
                <li>Limited data retention (7 days for logs)</li>
                <li>No storage of personal information</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>

            <h3>Access and Control</h3>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access your data:</strong> Your ratings are in your browser's localStorage (open DevTools → Application → Local Storage)</li>
                <li><strong>Export your data:</strong> Use our export tool at export_ratings.html</li>
                <li><strong>Delete your data:</strong> Clear your browser's localStorage or use browser settings → Clear browsing data</li>
                <li><strong>Stop using the site:</strong> You're free to leave anytime, no account to delete</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Do Not Track</h3>
            <p>We respect Do Not Track (DNT) browser signals. However, since we don't track you by default, enabling DNT won't change anything. You're already not tracked.</p>

            <h3>Cookie Controls</h3>
            <p>TechPulse does not use cookies. If you see cookies from our domain, please contact us—it's likely a bug.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>TechPulse is a general-audience site focused on AI and technology news. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. Since we don't collect personal information from anyone, this naturally extends to children.</p>
            
            <p>If you're a parent and have concerns, please contact us.</p>

            <h2>International Users</h2>
            
            <h3>Data Location</h3>
            <p>Our server is located in [Your Server Location]. Your ratings never leave your device, so they stay in whatever country you're in.</p>

            <h3>GDPR (European Users)</h3>
            <p>If you're in the European Union:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> We process the minimal server logs based on legitimate interest (keeping the site functional and secure)</li>
                <li><strong>Your rights:</strong> You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, port, and object to processing. Since we don't collect personal info, most of these rights don't apply, but you can always contact us</li>
                <li><strong>Data Protection Officer:</strong> Given our minimal data processing, we don't have a formal DPO, but you can contact us at the email below</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>CCPA (California Users)</h3>
            <p>If you're in California:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We don't sell your personal information (and never will)</li>
                <li>We don't discriminate based on privacy choices</li>
                <li>You have the right to know what we collect (see "Server Logs" above)</li>
                <li>You have the right to delete (contact us)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top</li>
                <li>We'll highlight significant changes on our homepage for 30 days</li>
                <li>We'll never make changes that retroactively reduce your privacy protections</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Your continued use of TechPulse after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

            <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
            <p>Privacy is not a feature we can remove in a future update—it's fundamental to how TechPulse is built. We commit to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimalism:</strong> Collect only what's necessary for the site to function</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Be honest about what we do and don't do</li>
                <li><strong>User control:</strong> Give you maximum control over any data we touch</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Protect what little data we have with reasonable measures</li>
                <li><strong>No monetization of data:</strong> Your privacy is not for sale, ever</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
                <p>TechPulse is designed to be a <strong>private-by-default</strong> information resource. We don't track you, we don't build profiles, we don't sell data. Your ratings stay on your device. We see only what's technically necessary to serve you web pages.</p>
                <p><strong>If you find this refreshing, please share TechPulse with others who value privacy.</strong></p>
